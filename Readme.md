So I definitely need to modify some things.

I set a discrete height to each div container, and I don't know if that's what's screwing other pieces up.

But to make the page look like the picture I ended up removing a lot of the flex characteristics that would make the page responsive and able to grow/shrink.

I'm going to finish up making the page appear like the picture, but I want to experiment more with making everything actually grow or shrink together cohesively.

Probably go back and check what Odin/IIH had me do, and take note of how they manage containers with respect to sizing to allow for things to properly shrink and grow.

I don't think it was working how I'd have liked even when I was using 25vw for height anyway, so needed to look at this no matter what.

Overall:
    Just realized if I used one container for the whole page I could see a global margin, although I could just do that in the first * { } too maybe?

I finished making it look like the page, but I'm very unhappy with the usability.  Almost nothing is responsive, but I used flexbox like a neanderthal with a rock as a hammer to make things look the way I wanted.

On to the next lesson.
